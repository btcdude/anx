#ANX API v2 Node Client

#WARNING: this is a fairly new implementation and a WIP - it is suggested you test carefully. ANX provides sandbox environments.

ANX implemented a MTGOX v2 compatible implementation for their polling API. This is a fork of https://github.com/ameensol/node-mtgox-apiv2

To use this, you must have created an API Key on their [website](https://anxpro.com).

The ANX library is currently transitioning from their MTGOX clone on v2 to a new v3. They have different message formats and standards, please consult:
Consult http://docs.anxv2.apiary.io and http://docs.anxv3.apiary.io/ for details.

Consult the following URL for decimal places.
